### About

You play as a naughty kid dressed up as an internet troll for Halloween! 

True to your costume, you are an annoying brat who collects candy and toilet paper to "troll" the people in each neighborhood block that you visit by "TP"ing their houses to terrorize them into giving you candy.

But beware! Each neighborhood block may have bullies dressed up as the undead who will beat you up for your candy.

You also eat a piece of candy for each step you take, so be sure not to run out of candy or you'll starve!
